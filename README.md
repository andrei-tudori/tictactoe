# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game project! This is a classic implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features modes for playing against another player or against a computer with varying levels of difficulty.

## Features

- **Single Player vs. Computer**: Play against an AI with adjustable difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard.
- **Multiplayer**: Play against another player on the same device.
- **Score Tracking**: Track scores for both player vs. player and player vs. computer modes.
- **High Score Storage**: Save and view high scores locally using `localStorage`.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to work on various screen sizes.
- **AI Implementation**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for optimal play.
